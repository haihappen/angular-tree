# angularTree

angularTree is a HTML5 drag and drop tree powered by Angular. Unlike other implementations of HTML tree widgets, angularTree allows you to bring your own markup (BYOM ðŸ˜„).

## Features

angularTree includes (but is not limited to) following features:

* Bring your own Markup
* AngularJS powered
* Besides Angular (uh oh) no other dependencies, not even jQuery!
* Support for modern browsers (IE8+)
* Written in CoffeeScript
* A test suite

## Installation

```sh
bower install angularTree
```

To use the master version, check out the source and then run
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

Add angularTree to the list of dependencies.

```js
angular.module('YourApp', ['angularTree'])
```

In your HTML you can now use the directive `angular-tree` to define the tree widget, and the `draggable` directive for defining the draggable elements (Note that the value of the directive must equal `"true"` otherwise browser support is not guaranteed).

```html
  <ul angular-tree>
    <li draggable="true">Alice</li>
    <li draggable="true">Bob</li>
    <li draggable="true">Charlie</li>
  </ul>

  <script src="angular.js"></script>
  <script src="angularTree.js"></script>
```
